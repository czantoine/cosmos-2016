# Cosmos 2016: A 3D Lunar Lander Game

![navette](img/nav.png)


**Cosmos 2016** is a 3D game inspired by the iconic science fiction series *Space: 1999*. This project was initially created when I was around 15-16 years old using **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **jQuery**, and 3D tools like **Blender**, **Three.js**, **Physi.js**, and **Ammo.js**. Although it‚Äôs an unfinished project, I believe it‚Äôs worth preserving and sharing on GitHub.

---

## üéÆ Game Concept

The game is a *Lunar Lander* simulation where players must land a spacecraft on the Moon's surface. The game world includes:  
- A **lunar scene** with a distant view of Earth.  
- A **Base Alpha**, inspired by the Moon base in *Space: 1999*.  
- Three types of spacecraft, including one **Eagle** model.  
- A **timer** to challenge players to land the spacecraft within a limited time.  

---

## üß© Features

- **Menu system**: Choose your spacecraft and initialize the game.  
- **3D environment**: A detailed lunar landscape created in Blender and rendered with Three.js.  
- **Physics-based gameplay**: Powered by Physi.js and Ammo.js for realistic movements.  

---

## üöÄ Backstory

In *Space: 1999*, nuclear waste stored on the Moon causes a massive explosion, sending the Moon and its inhabitants out of Earth's orbit and into deep space. The game is set in a similar alternate universe, where 311 survivors, led by Commander Koenig, navigate the challenges of space exploration.  

**Cosmos 2016** places you in the role of a pilot, tasked with safely landing a spacecraft on the Moon‚Äôs surface despite the challenges.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery  
- **3D Rendering**:  
  - Blender, Three.js  
- **Physics Engines**:  
  - Physi.js, Ammo.js

## üìú Unfinished Elements

While the game is functional in many ways, there are still areas for improvement:  
- **Collision detection**: Between the spacecraft and the lunar base.  
- **Refinement**: Menu UI and physics parameters.
